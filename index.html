                <h2>Code for Automated Reporting</h2>
                <p>We've implemented a Python script to automate quarterly data extraction and analysis.</p>
                <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                    import pandas as pd
                    
                    # Load financial data from a CSV file
                    df = pd.read_csv('quarterly_data.csv')
                    
                    # Calculate key metrics
                    df['net_profit_margin'] = (df['net_income'] / df['total_revenue']) * 100
                    
                    # Print results for the latest quarter
                    latest_quarter = df.iloc[-1]
                    print(f"Net Profit Margin for Q3: {latest_quarter['net_profit_margin']:.2f}%")

                    This is a snippet of the code we're now using. It helps us streamline our data processing and generate reports much faster, reducing manual errors.

                <h2>Financial Modeling</h2>
                <p>We use the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** to assess the expected return on our investments.</p>
                $$ E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f) $$
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment fade-in">$E(R_i)$ is the expected return on the asset.</li>
                    <li class="fragment fade-in">$R_f$ is the risk-free rate of return.</li>
                    <li class="fragment fade-in">$\beta_i$ (beta) is the volatility of the asset relative to the market.</li>
                    <li class="fragment fade-in">$E(R_m)$ is the expected return of the market.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                    This equation helps us determine if a new investment offers a suitable return for the level of risk involved. It's a fundamental part of our portfolio management strategy.
